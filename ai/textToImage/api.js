The lantern cage resembles crystalline formations of frost and inside, a blue wisp dances like a flickering flame. This creates long, intricâ€¦ld. The scene encapsulates the cold, mysterious aura of a high mountain summit and the secrets of an ancient lighthouse. Remember to use intricate filigree designs inspired by icicles, and flourishes suggesting gusts of wind and snow to embellish the design.

The scene is a location where a unique, faded book is subtly present but not the focus. The book should blend into the background, noticeable only upon closer inspection. Emphasize the environmental effects on the book, such as sand and sunlight. The book should be less prominent, almost hidden, and deeply integrated into its surroundings, like being partially covered by sand or near old machinery. Use cinematic techniques like deep shadows, light flares, and a dramatic interplay of light and dark for a moody atmosphere. Add rich textural details to highlight the raw, rugged aspect and introduce narrative elements to suggest the past life of the location. The image should have a vintage, film-like quality with grainy texture, soft focus, subdued colors, vignetting, and natural imperfections like light leaks or scratches. The book should not dominate the scene but be an integral, unemphasized part of it.

  pay attention to places, people, items climate described in it:

The book should not dominate the scene but be an integral, unemphasized part of it. add a sense of sad poeticness, and sense of urgency. be inspired by Akira Kurosawa all the way to Quentin Tarantino,. I want it raw...gritty,...natural light. rugged. the details are important: gender, how many people, the location, the time of day, the climate. I want to feel that we're caught in a moment. in the middle of something. the sense of urgency. it is not staged. it's as it happens. the storyteller detective face cannot be clearly seen.`
